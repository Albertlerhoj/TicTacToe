If you wanna run the code you can go to the terminal and the directory you are looking for is name
"A3". Then go to the "TicTacToe" folder by typing "dotnet build" and then "dotnet run". If it 
doesn't print anything the code should run fine but if there is an error in the code. You can also
test the code by typing "dotnet test TicTacToeTest" in the "A3" folder. I've also uploaded my code 
to run-autograding-test, by typing "git add ." then "git commit -m "first commit" and "git push".
